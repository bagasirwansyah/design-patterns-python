## A notes by Bagas Irwansyah

This repo is my notes used to jot down all my understanding regarding design patterns. My main source of information is the incredible [refactoring guru]. Some of the writing will be quoted from that website and will be added by my own comments and/or understanding regarding the design patterns in question.
